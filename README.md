# Borum Sphere for Web

## Installation

To run the app locally,

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/varunsingh87/borumsphere-web`
2. Either through the CLI or in your IDE, change into the directory
3. Run `npm run start`. This will open [http://localhost:3400](http://localhost:3400) in the browser
4. Change out of the directory to where you would like to store the backend
5. Clone the backend repository `git clone https://github.com/varunsingh87/BorumForum-API`
6. Run `php -S localhost:8400`
7. Change all fetch statements to use localhost:8400 instead of https://api.borumtech.com (This will be automatically done soon)
